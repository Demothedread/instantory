# 🛠️ UltimateNeoDecoLanding.js - Issues Fixed

## 🚨 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Styles Used Before Defined**
**Problem**: The responsive CSS section was trying to reference `styles` object properties before the object was fully defined, causing a circular reference error.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the problematic `@container` queries that were referencing `styles` properties
- Integrated responsive styles directly into each component's CSS definition using standard `@media` queries

### 2. **React Hook useEffect Missing Dependency**
**Problem**: The `useIntersectionObserver` hook had a missing dependency `'options'` in the useEffect dependency array.

**Solution**: 
- Added `options` to the dependency array: `}, [options]);`
- This ensures the effect re-runs when options change, following React's exhaustive-deps rule

### 3. **Container Queries Issues**
**Problem**: CSS Container Queries (`container-type: inline-size`) were causing compatibility issues and circular references.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `container-type: inline-size` from the main palazzo container
- Replaced all `@container` queries with standard `@media` queries for better browser compatibility
- Maintained responsive behavior while fixing the technical issues
