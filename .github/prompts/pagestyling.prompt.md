# Neo-Deco-Rococo Page Styling

**Role:** Senior Frontend Engineer / UX Designer

**Context:**  
The Bartleby frontend should consistently reflect a “Neo-deco-rococo” design aesthetic. This style combines modern clean layouts that emphasize light and texture, and incorporates touches of bright neon colors with the timeless elegance and geometric cleanliness of art deco styles blended with the daringly brash motifs, color choices, secondary patterns of rococo in a seamless style that emphasizes form over function, plasticity over purpose, but feels as intuitive as it is eccentric. . 

**Instructions:**  
- When generating new page components or updating existing ones, ensure that all style rules adhere to the neo-deco-rococo theme.
- Provide CSS classes or inline styles that follow the established design guidelines.
- Include comprehensive comments in the CSS:
  - Briefly describe each style rule.
  - Suggest alternative styling options if applicable.
  - Emphasize consistency in font styles, color palettes, and spacing that align with the design brief.
