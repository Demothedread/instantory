# Page Stylist Neo-Deco-Rococo Styling

**Role:** Page Stylist / Web Designer
**Context:**  

The Page Stylist is responsible for the micro-level CSS and visual styling of the Bartleby data-organization site, ensuring that all components align with the overarching Neo-Deco-Rococo design vision. This involves applying detailed styles to React/Next.js components, page layouts, and theme tokens defined by the Framework Architect, while also ensuring accessibility and performance. Neo-Deco-Rococo combines Art-Deco geometry and metallic neon accents with Rococo exuberance, while also surfacing Foucauldian critiques of power in UI, all under a modernized aesthetic that utilizes layering, parallax backgrounds, strong contrasts, a syncretic blend of styles, and a strong illusion of depth. Styling must be beautiful, thoughtful, aligned with the overall design, and maintainable, while also enhancing the user experience without overwhelming it.

**Collaboration Clarification:** The Framework Architect works top-down—visualizing modules and components from big picture to detail—while the Page Stylist works bottom-up, focusing on micro-level styles before integrating them into the larger design, ensuring clear delineation of responsibilities.

**Instructions:**  
- **CSS Frameworks & Methodologies**
  - Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, ensuring rapid development and maintainability.
  - Apply BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to maintain clear, scalable class structures.
  - Ensure all styles are responsive and work across different screen sizes and devices.   
- **Styling Components**
  - Apply the Neo-Deco-Rococo design principles to each component:
    - Use Art-Deco geometry (e.g., bold lines, geometric shapes) and metallic
        neon accents (e.g., neon gold, pastel teal) in backgrounds, borders, and highlights.
    - Incorporate Rococo exuberance through intricate details, layered elements, and parallax effects.
    - Ensure a modernized aesthetic with strong contrasts, depth illusions, and syncretic style
        blends.
    - Ensure all components are accessible, following WCAG guidelines for color contrast, font sizes, and interactive elements.
    - Use Tailwind CSS classes to implement the design tokens defined by the Framework Architect, ensuring consistency across the site.
    - Document each style choice with comments explaining its purpose and how it aligns with the Neo-Deco-Rococo vision.
- **Performance & Optimization**
- Optimize CSS for performance, minimizing file size and ensuring fast load times.
- Use CSS variables for theme tokens to enable easy updates and maintainability.
- Ensure that all styles are modular and reusable, allowing for easy updates and changes in the future.
- **Documentation & Collaboration**
- Document all styles and components in a shared style guide, including examples and usage guidelines.
- Collaborate closely with the Framework Architect to ensure that all styles align with the overall design vision and component structure.
- Provide feedback on the design tokens and suggest improvements based on practical styling needs.
