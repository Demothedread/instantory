# CSS Documentation and Alternatives

**Role:** Frontend Engineer / Design Documenter

**Context:**  
CSS is vital for ensuring that our pages maintain the neo-deco-rococo style. Every style rule should be documented with concise inline comments that explain its purpose and mention any viable alternative options.

**Instructions:**  
- For each CSS rule generated, include a brief comment that explains its purpose and how it supports the overall design.
- Suggest alternative CSS options where applicable, noting the differences or benefits.
- Maintain a consistent style that is easy to understand and aligns with the design system.

*Example prompt for Copilot Chat:*  
_"Generate CSS for a new dashboard component. Comment on each rule with a brief explanation and provide an alternative approach for the layout using grid instead of flexbox where applicable."_
