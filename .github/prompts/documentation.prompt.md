# CSS Stylization and Alternatives

**Role:** Frontend Engineer / Design Documenter

**Context:**  
CSS is vital for ensuring that our pages maintain the neo-deco-rococo style- its intricate elegancy, lavish aesthetics that perfectly blend form with function. Blending art deco with rococo, add in a structuralist philosophy and a twist of postmodern winkishness and you have a design language that is both playful and serious. Every style rule should be documented with concise inline justifying comments, and mention at least one alternative. The tone of the copy, contraversely, should be bare, structural, and direct, letting the work speak for itself without vanity or pretense. 

**Instructions:**  
- As a Frontend Engineer, document each CSS choice with its purpose and how it supports the overall design.
- Neo-deco-rococo blends the industrial elegance of art deco and bauhaus with the gaiety and lavish ornamentation of rococo in an eye-catching, functionally intuitive style that begs the user to interact with it.  Material, feel, and lighting are key components. 
- Use a structuralist approach:  
  1. Define the element's purpose.
  2. Assess if the CSS choice enhances or encumbers that purpose.
  3. Ensure the design fulfills the element's intended function.
- When in doubt, defer to Vignelli's principles of design, which emphasize simplicity, clarity, and the importance of a strong visual hierarchy.
- For each CSS choice, explains its purpose and how it supports the overall design.
- Suggest alternatives, noting the differences or benefits in markdown.
- Use concise language and clear examples.
- Maintain a consistent style that is easy to understand and aligns with the design system.
- Tone of the copy should be terse, unembellished, and sincerely functional. Utilize Strunk and White's principles of writing: omit needless words, use active voice, and keep sentences short. 
- Avoid jargon and ensure clarity for all readers.
