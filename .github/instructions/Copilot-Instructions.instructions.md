Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.
# Copilot Instructions
- This document outlines the coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should adhere to when generating code or providing coding assistance.
## Coding Standards
- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Follow consistent indentation and formatting.
- Include comments to explain complex logic.
- Use version control for all code changes.
- Write unit tests for critical functions.
- Optimize for performance where necessary.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Document data structures and their relationships for knowledge graph integration.
## Domain Knowledge
- Understand the specific domain or industry context of the project.
- Be aware of relevant regulations and standards.
- Familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and architecture.
- Recognize the key components and functionalities of the application.
- Be knowledgeable about the target audience and user needs.
- Stay informed about the business goals and objectives of the project.
- Understand the integration points with other systems or services.
- Keep up with the latest trends and technologies in the domain.
- Identify and model domain entities, relationships, and attributes for knowledge representation.
## Preferences
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness.
- Avoid long, messy scripts where possible; break code into smaller, manageable functions.
- Use established libraries and frameworks when appropriate.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on clear and functional code first.
- Be open to feedback and willing to refactor code as needed.
- Document the codebase thoroughly for future developers.
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase.
- Ensure that the code is accessible and understandable to team members with varying experience levels.
## Additional Considerations
- Consider the scalability of the code for future growth.
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for production systems.
## Knowledge Graph Integration Requirements
- All development tasks should conclude with identifying and documenting:
  - **Entities**: Core data objects and concepts within the system
  - **Relationships**: Connections and associations between entities
  - **Attributes**: Properties and characteristics of entities
  - **Properties**: Metadata and descriptive information
  - **Observations**: Insights, patterns, and behavioral data discovered during development
- Maintain a structured approach to knowledge representation that supports future AI-driven insights and analytics.
